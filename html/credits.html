			<B>Sudokool V 2.5 - 15 Feb 2009</B>
			</P>
			<P><B>The Story so far ...</B></P>
			<P>It all started back in 2005 when I was learning Core Java 1.4,
			after completion of my Engineering in Electronics and
			Communications. I needed a small project to brush up and practise
			all the knowledge gained. Sudoku puzzles had gained so popularity
			that they were part of all the newspapers and magazines since then.
			It was a dual challenge for me : a sudoku solver algorithm and a
			GUI interface. <p>Sudukool was launched on 25<SUP>th</SUP> Sep
			2005. It was just a soduku solver. There were 100 puzzles in 3
			difficulty levels. I had made the solver algorithm after studying
			the sudoku solving techniques. The biggest limitation was that it
			didn't have sudoku puzzle generation. <p>Due to the busy
			professional life, it was only after 3 years, that I thought to
			upgrade Sudokool to V2. Sudokool is now not limited in any terms
			and has all the features of a commercial counterpart.<p> I wish
			to extend my thanks to Jacques Bensimon (jacques@ipm.com)
			for releasing QQWing under GNU General Public License, without which
			I could not have achieved this.
			</p><p>I would
			like to thank all Sudokool lovers who took time to wrote back to
			me. I would really appriciate any suggestions, feedbacks and
			criticism. <p>Please write back to me at <B>shirazakhan@gmail.com</B>
